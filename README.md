# Kue Workers (by Pollygot)

A KueJS implementation for common async tasks (written in Typescript). 

Kue Workers has the following:

- Facebook Bots
- Mailgun
- Slack
- Telegram
- Twilio


## Development

If you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to npm run build), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task > npm: start` to run npm start for you.
